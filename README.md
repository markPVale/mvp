# Focus

Focus is a time-management assistant that prompts you to reflect on and document the progress, issues and blockers that were encountered during the specified time alotted for your task.

* Set the timer and allow Focus to run on an open browser window. 
* When the time has completed, a modal will display and interrupt your current browser window. 
* Document your progress in the modal and submit. 
* Focus saves your entries for retrieval.
